A bunch of simple python scripts to make taking notes in vim and sending emails to outlook useful.  These are complete hacks but I'd rather not code them again so publish :)

All of these work by sucking data from the clipboard - transforming the data - then setting them back to the clipboard.

clipboard_attendees.py - take a list of outlook attendees and create a basic meeting note template

clipboard_formatter.py - take text markup and convert it to html

clipboard_remove_html_style.py - remove toxic SharePoint html formatting

clipboard_to_txt.py - convert the styled text to ascii in the clipboard

HtmlClipboard.py - can be found here - http://code.activestate.com/recipes/474121
